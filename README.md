# Hello, I'm Joe Anthony-Brown üëã

## Thanks for visiting my github profile ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I'm a software developer from New York, currently living in Minneapolis.
I enjoy making art, traveling, and games (tabletop and video).

I also really enjoy creating applications and working on interesting projects for other people.

While I can't show off the majority of my professional work here, I can share a few of my personal and group projects.

Please find descriptions of a few projects I have worked on below. The corresponding repositories are also here in github. I hope you enjoy!
