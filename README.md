# Hello, I'm Joe Anthony-Brown üëã

## Thanks for visiting my github profile ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I'm a software developer from New York, currently living in Minneapolis.
I enjoy making art, traveling, and games (tabletop and video).

I also really enjoy creating applications and working on interesting projects with other people.

While I can't show off the majority of my professional work here, I can share a few of my personal and group projects.

Please find descriptions of a few projects I have worked on below. The corresponding repositories are also here in github. 

I hope you enjoy!

## Get SmArt - A flashcard deck creator geared towards art history students and teachers.

I've taken a lot of art history exams in my life, for which I had to memorize a lot of information about images of famous works of art. My classmates and I would usually make our own flashcards in order to prepare for these tests, however it was sometimes unclear exactly what images we would need to memorize, and it was always a huge waste of paper.

I created GetSmArt to help art history instructors create more well-defined expectations for their students, and to make it easier and more fun for students to study for their upcoming exams! I'm still adding features and functionality to this, so as I update the app I will update here as well.

When you register, you will need to identify yourself as a student or instructor. In this video you can see what it looks like to sign in as an instructor who has already created a few galleries of images for their students.

For each class, an instructor can create any number of galleries. All of the images and information they enter into these galleries can be easily altered or removed.

A student's view of the galleries takes the form of a game. The descriptive fields need to be filled out correctly in order to score points. These points are saved so they can come back any time to try to beat their previous scores.


## AllyX - A walking companion on your phone.

I worked with a small group of developers to create this app for a client. The videos below do not represent the final product, but they are pretty close to it.

AllyX is a service that connects users to vetted volunteers in safe, casual phone conversations. For example, if you were walking home from a party or a night out and would feel safer with someone to talk to, or are just kinda bored, you could use AllyX to request a phone conversation with one of their vetted allies.

As a volunteer ally, you can view calls that have been requested, in order of those that have been waiting the longest. Once you choose one, you are prompted to start the call. Afterwards, both the ally and the user are prompted to leave a review of their experience.

As an administrator, AllyX offers an overall view of all of the users, allies, reviews, and calls.

...more to come
